      <font size="4">O</font>ur laboratory focuses on understanding etiologies of human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and pain conditions, such as hyperalgesia. We have utilized several integrated computational and experimental strategies to <i>understand, sense (recognize and report), and control</i> aberrant biological molecules, and uncover etiologies of human diseases. We have developed approaches to molecular structural modeling and dynamic simulations, allowing study of structure and dynamics of biological molecules at time scales relevant to biological systems. These approaches uniquely integrate rapid physical dynamics simulations, experiments, and molecular modeling and design, allowing us to make significant breakthroughs in understanding etiologies of CF and ALS. Such integration allows us to perform translational research: from understanding molecular players at atomic level to probing their function at the cellular and organism level, as well as discovering molecular therapeutic strategies to affect these players.
